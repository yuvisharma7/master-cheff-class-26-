recipe for mac and cheese 
Use block cheese and shred, do not buy the pre-shredded cheese. The pre-shredded cheese is great for so many things but not macaroni and cheese. It’s coated and won’t melt properly. You need to shred it yourself for the best result.
Cook your pasta to slightly less than al dente, about one minute shy is perfect. The reason is that this is baked mac and cheese so the pasta will continue to cook in the homemade cheese sauce in the oven. You don’t want soggy macaroni.
I used elbow pasta but really, any tubular past will work.
This mac and cheese recipe starts with a roux. The roux is super important to getting the creamiest cheese sauce of your life. Here is what you need to look for:
The roux (equal parts butter and flour) is whisked together until bubbly and golden.
Whisk in cold milk – not warm – to prevent the flour from clumping.
Cook the roux until  you see bubbles on the surface and then continue cooking for an additional 2 minutes before adding the cheese.
